==================

Starts a server that periodically and on-demand runs a suite of Frisby.js tests against your APIs.  In the event of an error, an email is sent (coming soon).

Getting started
---------------
1.  Install the package dependencies.  From the project root, run `npm install`.
2.  Verify the setup by running the tests, run `jasmine-node spec/*`.
3.  Start the server, run `node app.js`.
